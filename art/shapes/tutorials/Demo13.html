<font size=7><h3>Ecstasy Motion SDK</h3></center>
We are actively developing the Ecstasy Motion SDK, which will allow you to use the <font size=7 color=darkgreen>Physics, AI, and Scene Event</font> features of Ecstasy in your own T3D based game.<p><h4></h4>

We don't know for sure about the price, but expect this much:<br>
1. It will probably be around $400.<br>
2. Standalone Ecstasy Motion included.<br>
3. Buy the EA now, and we put the price you paid toward your SDK purchase.<br>
