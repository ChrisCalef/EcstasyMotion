Behind this sign lies a (pathetic) attempt at a zombie shooting<br>
game, demonstrating Ecstasy Motion physics and AI Behaviors.<p>
As you will quickly notice, it is <font size=7 color=darkgreen><b>not at all finished</b></font>.  The zombies frequently<br>
get stuck, and you often can't shoot them for some reason.  We plan to<br>
improve this sample game and add more demos as time allows.<p>
As it is,  you'll have to try pretty hard to get yourself killed.  If you do,<br>
however, just hit the space bar or left mouse and you'll start over.
