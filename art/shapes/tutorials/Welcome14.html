<font size=7><h1>T3D MIT</h1><p>

Ecstasy Motion was built as a plug-in for the extremely powerful<br>
World Editor tool in Torque.  In addition to the tools Ecstasy provides,<br>
stock T3D offers environment features like Sky, Terrain, Water, Forests,<br>
Road & River editors, Particle systems, Camera paths, and much more. <p>

Torque has always been a great engine, but with the exciting release<br>
of T3D 1.2 under the <font size=7 color=darkgreen><b>MIT Open Source License</b></font>, the sky is now officially<br>
the limit for the creative work that can be done with Torque.<p>

Many users may wish to take advantage of these capabilities and capture<br>
their final footage from within Ecstasy Motion itself.<br>
